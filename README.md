# LLama3-Powered-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-System-

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by LLaMA3. It enables efficient querying of multiple documents(pdfs, excel sheets, ppts, and word documents) The above model works for pdfs and excel sheets to generate accurate, context-aware responses(sample pdf has been attached for reference). Designed for offline use, it ensures data privacy while providing robust natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
